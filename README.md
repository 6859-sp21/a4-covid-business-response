### An overview of your development process. 
We first sketched multiple designs by hand and met to discuss what we could potentially do. We also reviewed online D3 examples for inspiration on Observable and d3js.org.

Once we agreed on the design, we leveraged Github to share quick iterations of the graph. We split features and subcomponents (e.g. Taylor to do gauge chart, Felix to format data in JSON...) and stayed in touch frequently.

In the end, the whole process took in the order of **20-30 hours across the two of us**.

The **hardest piece** by far was to get the first iteration of the graph, as most D3 examples were in Observable and couldn't be easily leveraged. 

This proved to be a significant pain point about both Observable and D3. We also noticed that many examples used older versions of D3 and required significant work to be useable.

Agreeing on the Sunburst design also took us a significant amount of time as we initially explored other designs such as maps.
